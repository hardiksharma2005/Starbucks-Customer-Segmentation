## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an unsupervised machine learning pipeline to segment Starbucks app users based on their purchasing behavior and interaction with marketing offers. The goal was to move beyond simple demographic targeting and identify behavioral personas (e.g., "BOGO Hunters," "High-Value Loyalists") to optimize marketing ROI.

**Key Achievements:**
* **Funnel Analysis:** Uncovered key behavioral trends: **76%** of offers were received, **75%** viewed, but only **44%** completed, with a sharp **2-day peak** in completions.
* **Feature Engineering:** Developed custom metrics like **View Rate** and **Completion Rate** to quantify customer engagement, identifying high-intent users vs. passive viewers.
* **Cluster Comparison:** Compared K-Means and DBSCAN Clustering to identify distinct customer personas.
* **Business Strategy:** Derived targeted marketing strategies for each segment (e.g., Exclusive Rewards for Whales, Volume Discounts for Frequent Coffee Drinkers).
